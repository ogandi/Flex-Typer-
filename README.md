### About the Project
Inspired by typing games like Ztype, Flex Typer takes a unique approach by combining a typing test with Gemini AI, allowing players to type dynamic text thatâ€™s generated based on their inputs. My goal was to not only create a fun and interactive experience but also to level up my skills in React, API integration, and CSS.

While initially aiming to replicate a more complex game using canvas (like Ztype), I quickly realized that mastering a new framework along with React might be a bit too ambitious. So, I pivoted to building a game similar to Monkeytype, but with a twist: I integrated a backend to handle API calls and store your WPM scores in a database.

One of my goals was to sharpen my CSS skills, as I wanted to move beyond basic styling. I dove into animations, transitions, and layering techniques (hello, Peeping Joe!), which I feel really enhanced the overall user experience.

In the end, I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project. React's virtual DOM and re-rendering made state management smooth and efficient. It's been a great learning journey!
